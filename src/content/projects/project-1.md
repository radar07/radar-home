### Astro Blog/Portfolio

![My site](/astro-blog.png)

[Astro](https://astro.build) ðŸš€ is a Javascript web framework optimized for building fast, content-driven websites. You heard it right! Content-driven. That is why I chose Astro to build this site. This is entirely built in **Astro**, **TailwindCSS**, and **Typescript** (no other frameworks).

The best way to start is by building from scratch by going through the official [tutorial](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/0-introduction/) or choose one from one of the hundreds of [themes](https://astro.build/themes/) that are posted on the internet.
