## A guide to pass the Terraform Associate certification

![Terraform Associate badge](/hashicorp-certified-terraform-associate-003.png)
Terraform is an IaC (Infrastructure as Code) tool and if you don't know about IaC or Terraform, I would highly recommend to go through the [official docs](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/intro). Because this is not the right place for that! ;)

I've been learning Terraform for the past couple of weeks and that was enough for me to pass the exam. So, I guess this might help someone out there to prepare and pass (sort of).

### Is it really hard?

If you put in the work and time to this, it is not really that hard. It took me just 3 weeks to prepare for the certification.
